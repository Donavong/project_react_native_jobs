# Build and Deploy a React Native App 
download the Expo Go app on your mobile device 
I have added the QR codes for both android and IOS  in the folder under assets. 
I also added the links below if you are having trouble still just follow the directions below in your terminal. 
Open my project in your terminal and run "expo-cli start --tunnel" in the terminal and scan the QR code on your phone and it will automatically run on the Expo Go app.
